A 32-domain expert system built on Qwen3.5-4B with MoE-LoRA stacks, cognitive layer (memory palace, negotiator, anti-bias), and triple-device serving. Fits on RTX 4090 24 GB.

## What

Five tightly integrated layers that turn a small base model into a specialist team:

1. **Base**: Qwen3.5-4B (Apache 2.0, GatedDeltaNet hybrid, 262K ctx, 201 languages, thinking mode)
2. **32 MoE-LoRA stacks**: one per domain, 4 experts × rank 16 each, ~150 MB per stack, ~4.8 GB total
3. **Meta-router**: sigmoid 32 outputs + training-free dispatcher (7 meta-intents)
4. **Cognitive layer**:
   - **Aeon memory palace** (Atlas SIMD index + Trace neuro-symbolic graph) — persistent, spatial, temporal-aware memory
   - **Negotiator** (CAMP arbitration + Catfish dissent) — resolves conflicts between active stacks with adaptive judge (Qwen3.5-35B fast ↔ Mistral-Large-Opus deep)
   - **KnowBias + RBD anti-bias** — neuron-level debiasing (before+after stacks) + runtime detector
5. **Serving**: vLLM with dynamic LoRA (kxkm-ai RTX 4090) OR mlx-lm (Mac Studio), with Apple Neural Engine triple pipeline (draft, scorer, router) as an optional accelerator

## Architecture

```
  user prompt
      ↓
  [Dispatcher]    → 7 meta-intents (training-free, zero latency)
      ↓
  [Aeon recall]   → inject top memories into context
      ↓
  [Meta-router]   → sigmoid 32 → activate 2-4 stacks
      ↓
  [Base + stacks] → K candidate responses
      ↓
  [Negotiator]    → CAMP arbitration (Qwen35B) / Mistral-Large if deep needed
      ↓
  [Anti-bias]     → RBD flag → DeFrame re-gen if biased
      ↓
  [Aeon write]    → persist the turn

## Domains (32)

Organized in 6 curriculum phases:

1. **Foundations** (chat-fr, reasoning)
2. **Coding core** (python, typescript, cpp, rust)
3. **Coding secondary** (html-css, shell, sql, yaml-json, docker, kicad-dsl, spice, lua-upy)
4. **Technical** (embedded, stm32, iot, freecad, platformio, power, emc, dsp, spice-sim, electronics, kicad-pcb)
5. **Applications** (web-frontend, web-backend, music-audio, devops, llm-orch)
6. **Complements** (math, security)

Full list: `docs/specs/2026-04-15-micro-kiki-design.md`.

## Teachers

Used for distillation, preference pair generation, and the adaptive judge:

- **Mistral-Large-Opus** (123B, Studio) — reasoning, general, deep judge
- **Qwen3.5-122B-A10B Opus-v3** (Studio, same family as base) — primary distill teacher
- **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B Opus** (kxkm-ai) — fast teacher and default judge
- **Devstral-v3/v4** (kxkm-ai) — coding-specific teacher

## Hardware

| Machine | Role |
|---------|------|
| Mac Studio M3 Ultra 512 GB | Teacher serving + primary training + deep judge + ANE pipeline |
| RTX 4090 24 GB (kxkm-ai) | Inference + Unsloth training + fast judge |

## Research foundations

The design is grounded in 2025–2026 published work:

- **MoLoRA** (arxiv 2603.15965) — composable specialization via per-token routing; Qwen3-1.7B + MoLoRA beats Qwen3-8B on reasoning benchmarks
- **OPLoRA** (arxiv 2510.13003) — orthogonal projection prevents catastrophic forgetting across sequential domains
- **LoRA-Null** (arxiv 2503.02659) — null-space initialization preserves pre-trained knowledge
- **Subspace Geometry** (arxiv 2603.02224) — forgetting is governed by gradient-subspace overlap, not rank
- **Aeon** (arxiv 2601.15311) — neuro-symbolic memory palace for long-horizon agents
- **CAMP** (arxiv 2604.00085) — evidence-based arbitration beats majority voting
- **Catfish Agent** (arxiv 2505.21503) — structured dissent disrupts silent consensus
- **KnowBias** (arxiv 2601.21864) — neuron-level debiasing via targeted fine-tuning
- **RBD** (arxiv 2505.17100) — runtime reasoning-based bias detector
- **Temporal limits** (arxiv 2601.10132) — why 4B LLM is naze at quantitative forecasting, tools layer preferred

## Structure

> **Note:** this tree represents the **target layout** per the 102-step plan. Several directories (`src/memory/`, `src/cognitive/`, `deploy/`) do not exist yet — they are populated as ralph works through the plan. The current state reflects Phase I foundations only.

## Execution

Driven by the ralph loop skill:

```bash
cd /Users/electron/Documents/Projets/micro-kiki
MAX_ITERATIONS=10 uv run .ralph/loop.py
```

Each iteration picks one incomplete story, implements it, runs quality gates, commits, and exits.

## Roadmap

- **v0.1** (scope of this plan): 32 stacks + router + cognitive layer + serving + ANE + release
- **v0.2** (planned): temporal context (real-time clock, location, news slice) + future-reasoner (CoT temporal chains, calendar-aware planning). Deferred because LLM 4B underperforms dedicated time-series ML on quantitative forecasting (arxiv 2601.10132); context-injection + tools approach is more appropriate than new stacks.
